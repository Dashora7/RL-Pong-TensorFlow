# RL-Pong-TensorFlow
An experimental base of code to run a Reinforcement Learning algorithm with TensorFlow to teach an agent to play Pong (Open AI Gym)

model.py - a mostly functioning script with old tensorflow commands

keras_model.py - a developing script to run the same code with "tf.keras" instead

pong.py - driver script to actually run training. Decide which builder to import (model or keras_model) depending on what tensorflow model script you would lilke to use.
